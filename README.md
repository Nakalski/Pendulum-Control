# Pendulum-Control
I did this project with my friend [Andr√© Alessi](https://github.com/EngAndreAlessi) for a class in college. In this article, a theoretical survey of the main basics of an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) is made, as well a application in Control Engineering, using the ANN to solve a inverted pendulum problem in a graphical enviroment made by OpenAI. For the development was used Python with Tensorflow.
